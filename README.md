Today's task was to understand and practically deploy a serverless cloud function using Google Cloud Functions. You learned to create a function that executes code automatically in response to events, without managing any servers. The process involved writing a simple function, deploying it on Google Cloud, testing its response with either a browser or CLI command, and understanding basic cloud automation concepts.â€‹

This exercise helps you gain experience with event-driven programming, serverless architecture, cloud deployment steps, and modern resource optimization. It sets the foundation for further exploration into scalable and cost-effective cloud solutions.
